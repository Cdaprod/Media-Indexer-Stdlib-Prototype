# Subject: Enclosure Design for Raspberry Pi–Based NINJAPI Prototype

#### Hi [Designer Name],

I hope you’re well. My name is David Cannan--I’ve been building a digital asset manager & camera-monitor device (code-named "NINJAPI") on Raspberry Pi with:
  • 1.14″ ST7789 SPI TFT display  
  • GPIO–driven Bubble Tea TUI  
  • On-board power management (5 V/2 A via USB-C)  
  • Tailscale networking for remote access  

I’m now at the stage where I need an industrial design / mechanical engineer to:
  1. Define external dimensions & mounting points  
  2. Design a two-piece injection-mold or CNC-machined enclosure
  3. Provide 3D CAD files (STEP/IGES) for prototyping  
  4. Specify material, finishes, and assembly methods  

Could we talk sometome to discuss scope, timeline, and rough draft? I’d love to show you the prototype and my rough sketches, then hear your thoughts on manufacturability and ergonomics.

Thanks for your time,  
David Cannan

🎤 On-Camera Script -- "Watch Me Spawn a Billion-Dollar Media Stack Before My Coffee Cools"

(2-min punch-up, heavy on David-flair, light on lecturing)

⸻

0 : 00 – 0 : 10 -- Kick-Door Open

Face-cam, grin
"Morning, internet! David here -- triplet-dad, DevOps trouble-maker, certified button-masher. ☕
See this blank terminal? In ten seconds it’ll run the same storage and search toys the FAANG kids pay millions for."

⸻

0 : 10 – 0 : 25 -- Flex Setup

Quick cut to code window, repo root shown
"This repo’s my playground: That DAM Toolbox.
DAM as in Digital Asset Management …and yes, also ‘damn, that’s slick.’"

⸻

0 : 25 – 0 : 45 -- The One-Liner

Fullscreen terminal, fingers ready
"Zero YAML edits, zero cloud bills--just:"

docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yaml \
  -f docker/compose/infra.yaml up -d

Hit Enter, logs fly
"Boom! MinIO spins up, Postgres wakes, Weaviate loads its brain.
I call this my ‘$3 laptop ∞-dollar backend’ trick."

⸻

0 : 45 – 1 : 05 -- Flash Tour (Rapid B-roll)
	•	MinIO console tab: "Buckets already seeded--my entrypoint did the paperwork."
	•	Weaviate GraphQL UI: "Vector search locked and loaded. Ask it ‘dog on skateboard’--it’ll know."
	•	pgAdmin: "Tables for clip metadata--boring but bulletproof."

⸻

1 : 05 – 1 : 30 -- Personal Hook

Back to cam, hold up DSLR or phone
"Why? Because I shoot HOURS of footage of those three maniacs I call sons.
The toolbox slurps it, tags it, hides the embarrassing dance moves--saves me life-hours."

⸻

1 : 30 – 1 : 50 -- Show the Magic

Drag a file into _INCOMING/; terminal shows auto-scan
"Drop, scan, done. Thumbnails in MinIO, embeddings in Weaviate, rows in Postgres--all while my coffee’s still ‘drinkable-ish’. Try doing that with a spreadsheet."

⸻

1 : 50 – 2 : 00 -- Sign-Off

Wink to camera
"Like the chaos? Smash the like, sling a sub, hijack the comments. Next episode I’ll teach MinIO to text me when the kids raid the snack shelf.
Hashtag #DevOpsDad--out!"

Exactly. They’ve got billion-dollar clusters solving everyone’s problems.
You? You’re solving your problems--with a handful of MP4s, a Pi cluster, and swagger.

🎙️ Add this to the Script (or Ad-lib it)

"They index the world. I just wanna index my camera footage and maybe some social clips.
Google ain’t comin’ to tag my DSLR videos, so I made That DAM Toolbox --
it’s like Google Photos, if it ran on Docker... actually respected you... and was dedicated to whatever you needed at the moment."

You’ve got something even better than FAANG:
🧠 full control
🧰 tailored stack
🔥 personality-driven DevOps

Keep the tone loud, personal, and lowkey genius.
You’re not showing them what to do -- you’re showing them what you do. That’s content gold.

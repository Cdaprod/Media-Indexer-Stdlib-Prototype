# AGENTS.md -- ThatDAMToolbox Engineering Guide

Welcome, Codex Agent (and human reviewers)!  
You are contributing to **ThatDAMToolbox**: a modular, containerized, open-source digital asset management system for live video, edge cameras, and ML workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure
- **Monorepo** with Go (services, daemons, API-gateways), Python (video modules), TypeScript/Next.js (frontend), and Docker Compose for orchestration.
- **Service folders**: Each service is self-contained and Dockerized.  
  Key folders: `capture-daemon/`, `api-gateway/`, `camera-proxy/`, `video-api/`, `web-app/`, `shared/`.

## üß™ Testing & Linting

- **Go**: Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...` before PRs.
- **Python**: Run `pytest` for `video-api` and modules.
- **Node/TS**: Run `yarn lint` and `yarn type-check` in `web-app`.
- All services must **start cleanly via Docker Compose**: `docker compose up --build` (CI will fail if not).

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Style

- **Go**:  
  - Use `gofmt`, `goimports`.
  - Package-level doc comments required for public APIs.
  - Avoid magic constants; use `config.go` or env vars.
  - Keep services stateless/idempotent where possible.
- **Python**:  
  - Use Black for formatting, isort for imports.
  - CLI/REST APIs must have docstrings.
- **TypeScript/Next.js**:  
  - Use Prettier (2-space), no semi-colons, single quotes.
  - Modular components go under `src/components/` or `src/modules/`.
  - **Never use the `/utils` directory for new logic** (deprecated).

## üß© Service Conventions

- **New service?** Add it under a new folder with Dockerfile, `go.mod`/`requirements.txt`, and a README.
- All services **communicate via RabbitMQ (events)**, and must gracefully reconnect.
- If you add a REST API:  
  - Prefix internal APIs with `/internal/`
  - Health checks: `/health` must return 200 OK when ready.
- Device scanners should surface full **capabilities** in API responses, using v4l2 when possible.

## üö¶ Git & PR Rules

- **Branch names**: kebab-case, scoped by feature/service (e.g. `capture/scanner-v4l2`)
- **Commits**: Conventional commits, e.g. `[feat]`, `[fix]`, `[chore]`.
- **PR base**: `main` branch only.
- Link related issues in PR description.

## üèóÔ∏è Build & Compose

- All new services **must be added to `docker-compose.yml`** with health checks.
- Sidecar containers (e.g. for Tailscale or overlay agents) must use shared networks as documented in Compose.

## üö´ Do Not

- Never use `aws` or `boto3`.
- Never hardcode device capabilities in frontend or backend; always pull from dynamic device scan.
- Never add new code to `utils/` folders--refactor or create a module.
- Never push generated code or `.env` files.

## ü§ñ Agent Responsibilities

- If device or camera hardware is not present, emit a `"system.alive"` or `"capture.ready"` event after broker connect, so UI/consumers can display a waiting state.
- Always write clear log messages for critical events, especially service startup, shutdown, device detection, and error states.
- When modifying camera scanning, API, or device broker logic, update and regenerate OpenAPI/Swagger docs in affected services.

## üìù Docs & Comments

- Update this `AGENTS.md` and the affected service‚Äôs `README.md` if you introduce new configuration, environment variables, or APIs.
- All public endpoints and events must be documented in Markdown and code comments.

## üè∑Ô∏è Tags & Hashtags

- For sample social posts or in-code banners, use:

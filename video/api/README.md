# API Package

FastAPI application exposing the toolbox over HTTP.  Modules that expose a `router` are automatically included at startup.

## Running

```bash
uvicorn video.api.api:app --reload
```

The `{action:list_devices}` file is a placeholder generated by tests and has no effect.

`modules.py` contains the autoâ€‘loader that imports any `video.modules.*` package.
